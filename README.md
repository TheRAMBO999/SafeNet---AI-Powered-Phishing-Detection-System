## Introduction

Phishing attacks have become some of the most widespread and lethal sorts of cyber threats against individuals, organizations, and even governments. Such attacks, based on social engineering techniques, mislead the users into parting with sensitive information like username-password combos, credit card details, and personal information. The transition of services into digital and dependence on online platforms expanded the range of threats immensely, thus posing a challenge to traditional detection mechanisms.

Phishing attacks are currently one of the most prevalent cyber threats that target users by posing as trustworthy entities in order to obtain mediums such as usernames, passwords along with financial data. Phishing continues to be a significant security challenge, even with security technologies having advanced to the point that it has accommodated for the continuous evolution of these attacks. Attackers exploit human error and trick users into giving up confidential data by using all manner of deceptive emails, fake websites, and social engineering tactics. Phishing techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated and classical rule based methods have fallen behind; hence increasingly sophisticated techniques are required.

Sensitive cybersecurity issues such as phishing detection have been addressed very well through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These technologies permit systems to learn from the history data and identify patterns that represent attempts to phishing, making accuracy and adaptability better. However, the heterogeneous nature of approaches employed in phishing poses a problem in that phishing detection needs to be a multi faced problem, since there are multiple machine learning models that need to be combined to ensure precision. In this paper, we present SafeNet, a complete AI based phishing detection system that uses a set of machine learning algorithms and methodologies to detect and stop the phishing attacks on time.

## Problem Definition

SafeNet aims to enhance the security and robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks, data breaches, and model vulnerabilities. The system integrates advanced detection mechanisms, anomaly detection, and secure model training techniques to safeguard neural networks from potential threats. SafeNet leverages encryption, adversarial training, and real-time monitoring to ensure data integrity, model reliability, and cross-platform security.

## Motivation/Challenges

- **Gaps in Traditional Systems:** Email filters, browser protections, and heuristic-based detection tend to weakly counter advanced phishing techniques.
 
- **Potential of Machine Learning:** Certain techniques of ML promise to identify patterns from large datasets and adapt to new threats.
  
- **Need for Real-Time Detection:** Users need feedback in real-time to avoid interaction with malicious phishing attempts that might compromise their security.
  
- **Cross-Platform Usability:** Sustainable protection across multiple electronic devices (PC, mobile devices, and browsers) must be ensured in the modern multi-platform digital environment.

## Objectives of the Work

- **Enhance Security** – Implement robust defense mechanisms to protect neural networks from adversarial attacks and data breaches. 

- **Anomaly Detection** – Develop real-time monitoring to detect and smitigate suspicious activities affecting model performance. 

- **Model Robustness** – Improve resilience against adversarial perturbations through secure model training techniques. 

- **Data Integrity** – Ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of input data using encryption and secure preprocessing. 

- **Cross-Platform Security** – Enable secure deployment of neural network models across different platforms with minimal vulnerability. 

- **Performance Optimization** – Balance security measures with computational efficiency to maintain high accuracy and low latency. 

- **Continuous Learning** – Integrate self-improving mechanisms to adapt to evolving threats and enhance overall security.
